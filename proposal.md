# Overview


### Leave No Trace is a web application that addresses logistical and attendence issues when trying to plan a party after a music event has ended.  It provides a web-based community that people can join to interact and plan with other people, to make the afterparty happen.

### In the web application people will be able to view events based on chronological order and when they open the event reply if they will be attending or not and able to add a post to the event page. 

### There will also be a feature where people can view photos from past events, view guidelines on how to respectfully party and clean up after the event, and possibly a section to where people can keep up with artists from the show.
